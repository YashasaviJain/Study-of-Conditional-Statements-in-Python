## STUDY OF CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS IN PYTHON

* Name – Yashasavi Jain
* PRN – 25070123127
* Batch – B-3
* Experiment – Conditional Statements in Python

## AIM

* To study conditional statements in Python
* To understand decision making using if, elif and else

## THEORY

* Conditional statements are used to make decisions in a program
* Python provides if, elif and else for condition checking
* Conditions are evaluated as True or False
* Based on condition result, a specific block of code is executed

## PROGRAM 1 – CHECK POSITIVE, NEGATIVE OR ZERO

* Algorithm
* Start
* Accept a number from user
* If number is less than zero, print Negative
* Else if number is greater than zero, print Positive
* Else print Zero
* Stop

## PROGRAM 2 – CHECK EVEN OR ODD

* Algorithm
* Start
* Accept a number from user
* Check number modulo 2
* If remainder is zero, print Even
* Else print Odd
* Stop

## PROGRAM 3 – FIND LARGEST OF THREE NUMBERS

* Algorithm
* Start
* Accept three numbers from user
* Compare first number with second and third
* Compare second number with first and third
* Print the largest number
* Stop

## PROGRAM 4 – CALCULATE GRADE USING MARKS

* Algorithm
* Start
* Accept marks from user
* If marks ≥ 90, print Grade A
* Else if marks ≥ 75, print Grade B
* Else if marks ≥ 60, print Grade C
* Else if marks ≥ 40, print Grade D
* Else print Fail
* Stop

## PROGRAM 5 – CHECK LEAP YEAR

* Algorithm
* Start
* Accept year from user
* If year is divisible by 400 or divisible by 4 and not by 100
* Print Leap Year
* Else print Not a Leap Year
* Stop

## PROGRAM 6 – INCREMENT DATE BY ONE DAY

* Algorithm
* Start
* Accept date in dd/mm/yyyy format
* Separate day, month and year
* Check maximum days of month
* Validate date
* Increment date by one day
* Display updated date
* Stop

## PROGRAM 7 – CHECK VOWEL OR CONSONANT

* Algorithm
* Start
* Accept a character from user
* Check if character is a vowel
* If yes, print Vowel
* Else print Consonant
* Stop

## PROGRAM 8 – CALCULATE GROSS SALARY

* Algorithm
* Start
* Accept basic salary
* If basic ≤ 10000, calculate HRA and DA
* Else if basic ≤ 20000, calculate HRA and DA
* Else calculate HRA and DA
* Calculate gross salary
* Display gross salary
* Stop

## PROGRAM 9 – CALCULATE INCOME TAX

* Algorithm
* Start
* Accept annual income
* If income ≤ 2,50,000, tax is zero
* Else calculate tax as per slab
* Display income tax
* Stop

## PROGRAM 10 – STRING SPLIT OPERATION

* Algorithm
* Start
* Create a string with comma separated values
* Split the string using comma
* Store values in variables
* Display each value
* Stop

## CONCLUSION

* Conditional statements help in decision making
* if, elif and else control program flow
* Various real-life problems can be solved using conditions
* All conditional statement programs were successfully executed
